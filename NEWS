Changes in version 1.11:

File diagnostics have been reformatted as 'PROGRAM: FILE: MESSAGE'.

Diagnostics caused by invalid arguments to command-line options now show the
argument and the name of the option.

The option '-o, --output' now preserves dates, permissions, and ownership of
the file when (de)compressing exactly one file.

The option '-o, --output' now creates missing intermediate directories when
writing to a file.

The variable MAKEINFO has been added to configure and Makefile.in.
